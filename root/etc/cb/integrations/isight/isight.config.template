# By default, the iSIGHT connector will only access the /view/iocs endpoint to retrieve the
# latest indicators from iSIGHT. This does not provide a threat score for each indicator, as this
# information is in the report itself. If iSightGetReports is set to true, the full reports will
# be downloaded in order to retrieve the threat score for each indicator. This requires your 
# account to be provisioned for access to the /report endpoint and may incur additional cost.
